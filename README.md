# calculatorðŸ§®
The following calculator appðŸ§® was built 3years ago (sept 2021) as part of my early journey in learning python programming the fun way. Mimicking [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) [Analytical engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine). The credit must be given to youtube, since this game was totally developed based on youtube learning. All [files](https://github.com/Kmohamedalie/calculator) have been made accessible in the repository, you can [download](https://github.com/Kmohamedalie/calculator/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and play the game using [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)  or [Visual studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
