# calculatorðŸ§®
The following calculator appðŸ§® was built 3years ago (sept 2021) as part of my early journey in learning python programming the fun way. The credit must be given to youtube, since this game was totally developed based on youtube learning. All [files](https://github.com/Kmohamedalie/calculator) have been made accessible in the repository, you can [download](https://github.com/Kmohamedalie/calculator/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and play the game using [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)  or [Visual studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
